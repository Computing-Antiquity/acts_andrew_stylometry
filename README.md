Repository for the paper a **Stylometric Perspectives on the Composition Debate of *Acts of Andrew***

## Overview
This repository contains the computational analysis and supporting materials for the paper "Stylometric Perspectives on the Composition Debate of *Acts of Andrew*." The study engages with the ongoing scholarly debate surrounding the composition of the *Acts of Andrew*, with particular focus on whether the *Acts of Andrew and Matthew in the City of the Cannibals* (AAM) should be considered an original part of the text.

## Research Question
Rather than offering definitive judgments or claiming methodological superiority, this research applies computational methods to the complete corpus to revisit and enrich the longstanding debate about the composition of the *Acts of Andrew*.

## Key Findings
- **Confirmation** of previous claims about the overuse of periphrastic constructions and prevalence of simple language in AAM
- **Nuanced support** for other scholarly observations, such as the positioning of verbs and grammatical simplicity
- **Systematic analysis** of the complete corpus, moving beyond selected excerpts that characterized prior studies

## Methodological Contribution
This study demonstrates the potential of computational approaches to:
- Revisit classical humanities problems using larger volumes of data
- Systematize previous scholarly claims that relied on small data samples
- Overcome limitations of manual counting of word and grammatical occurrences
